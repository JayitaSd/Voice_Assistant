# üéôÔ∏è Voice Assistant with ElevenLabs Conversational AI API

This project demonstrates how to create a **real-time voice assistant** using the [ElevenLabs Conversational AI API](https://elevenlabs.io/).  

The assistant:
- üé§ Records your voice through the microphone  
- üñ®Ô∏è Detects when you finish speaking or interrupt the assistant  
- ü§ñ Uses an LLM to generate responses  
- üìà Synthesizes speech from the response  
- üîä Plays the generated speech back through your speakers  

---

## üì¶ Features
- Real-time speech recognition  
- Smart voice activity detection (VAD)  
- AI-powered conversational responses  
- Natural, high-quality voice synthesis  
- Instant playback

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python
Make sure [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```text
git clone https://github.com/JayitaSd/Voice_Assistant.git
cd Voice_Assistant
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Python Packages

```text
pip install elevenlabs elevenlabs[pyaudio] python-dotenv
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install PortAudio (Required by PyAudio)

Processing the audio requires additional dedpendencies on Linux, MacOS and Windows
- For Linux, you will need to install [portaudio19](https://packages.debian.org/sid/portaudio19-dev )
    
  ```text
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
  ```

- For MacOs, you will need to install [portaudio](https://www.portaudio.com/)

  ```text
  brew install portaudio
  ```

- For Windows, you will need to install [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)

  ```text
  pip install pyaudio
  ```
    
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Eleven Labs

1. Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/app/sign-up) and follow the instructions to create an account.

2. Once signed in, go to "Conversational AI"

</p>

3. Go to "Agents"

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/agents.png" alt="Agents button on dashboard" width="80%"/>
</p>

4. Click on "Start from blank"

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/blank_agent.png" alt="Start from blank button" width="80%"/>
</p>

5. Create a ".env" file at the root of your project folder. We will use this file to store our API credentials securely. This way they won't be hardcoded in the script. In this ".env" file, add your Agent ID:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/agent_id.png" alt="Agent ID" width="80%"/>
</p>

```bash
AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
```

6. Go to the "Security" tab under your created agent, enable the "First message" and "System prompt" overrides, and save. This will allow us to customize the assistant's first message and system prompt using Python code.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/security.png" alt="Security tab" width="80%"/>
</p>

7. Click on your profile and go to "API keys". Create a new API key and copy it to your ".env" file:

```bash
API_KEY="sk_XXX...XXX"
```

**Please make sure to save your ".env" file after adding the credentials.**

  <img src="images/api_key.png" alt="API keys" width="80%"/>
</p>

ElevenLabs is now set up and ready to be used in our Python script!

**Note:** ElevenLabs works with a credit system. When you sign up, you get 10,000 free credits which amount to 15 minutes of conversation. You can buy more credits if needed.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ üõ† Fix: Replace Line 413 in conversation.py

In the original code, line 413 of conversation.py tries to access:
```text
{"user_id": self.config.user_id} if self.config.user_id else {}
```

This assumes that the ConversationConfig object always has a user_id attribute.
However, in newer versions of the pydantic-based configuration (and/or the ElevenLabs SDK), user_id is no longer defined in the ConversationConfig model.

When self.config.user_id is accessed and doesn't exist, Python raises an AttributeError:
```text
AttributeError: 'ConversationConfig' object has no attribute 'user_id'
```

Because the code tries to conditionally access a missing attribute, it fails before it can even decide to use {} as a fallback.
Replacing the line with simply {} ensures that the program does not attempt to access a non-existent attribute at all, avoiding the crash.

In the ElevenLabs Python SDK, conversation.py is usually located in the package‚Äôs source folder inside your Python environment. 
If installed via pip install elevenlabs, the typical path would be:

- Windows (venv example)

  ```text
  <your-project>\venv\Lib\site-packages\elevenlabs\conversational_ai\conversation.py
  ```

- Linux/macOs (venv example)

  ```text
  <your-project>/venv/lib/python<version>/site-packages/elevenlabs/conversational_ai/conversation.py
  ```

- Global installation (Linux/macOs)

  ```text
  /usr/local/lib/python<version>/dist-packages/elevenlabs/conversational_ai/conversation.py
  ```
  
- Global installation (Windows)

  ```text
  C:\Python<version>\Lib\site-packages\elevenlabs\conversational_ai\conversation.py
  ```

- If you‚Äôre unsure where it is in your setup, you can find it by running:

  ```text
  pip show elevenlabs
  ```

#### Before

```text
**({"user_id": self.config.user_id} if self.config.user_id else {})
```

- ‚ùå Breaks if self.config.user_id is missing.
- ‚ùå Depends on outdated SDK field.

#### After

```text
{}
```

- ‚úÖ Works regardless of ConversationConfig changes.
- ‚úÖ Avoids accessing missing attributes.
- ‚úÖ Maintains compatibility with newer ElevenLabs SDK versions.
